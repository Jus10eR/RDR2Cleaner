## RDR2 Mod Cleaner

This Python script offers a swift solution for managing your mods in Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) when transitioning between modded and unmodded gameplay. It simplifies the process of temporarily removing mods, enabling you to effortlessly switch to Red Dead Online or the vanilla game. When you're ready to dive back into modding, the script allows for seamless restoration of your mods.

### Usage

1. Place the script in the same directory as your RDR2 game executable (`rdr2.exe`).
2. Run the script. You will be prompted to confirm moving your mods by entering `y` in the terminal.
3. The script will organize specific files, like DLLs, into a "storedMods" folder for safekeeping.
4. When desired, run the script again. It will relocate the files back to the game folder, restoring your mods.

### Note

- Always maintain backups of your game files before using the script.
- This utility doesn't modify or delete your files; it solely reorganizes them for convenience.
- For complete peace of mind, it's recommended to test the script with a small set of files before widespread usage.

Switch effortlessly between the pure RDR2 experience and the captivating world of mods with the efficiency of this script.
